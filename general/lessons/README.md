# Lessons (in order):
 * [getting started](getting-started) - python interpreter & installing python, git, and a text editor
 
 * [printing and arithmetic](basics)
 * [variables & `raw_input()`](variables) - get input from the user, use text and numbers stored as variables
 * [types](types) - learn about integers, floats, strings, and converting between types
 * [conditionals & booleans](logic) - learn about if/else/elif, booleans, boolean logic, and comparing values
 * [software engineering & debugging](debugging)
 * [lists](lists) - a new kind of variable: lists of variables! These are **not** the same as arrays.
 * [loops](loops) - want to know how to make something repeat over and over? Click [here](loops/funny-joke)!
 * [functions](functions) - chunks of code that you can repeat at any point in one line, and can work like math functions (like `f(x)`)
 * [DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself](dry) - become a good programmer by not unnecessarily repeating code. Sorry if this lesson is a bit dry.
 * [Classes](classes) - **Q:** Who doesn't like object-oriented programming? **A:** lots of people
 * [Modules](modules) - use code from other files and helpful code that other people have made for you
 * [Git & GitHub](git) - version-control system, for collaborating on projects. No, it's not like Google Drive. Git is difficult until you get the hang of it.
 * [Code Review](code-review) - practice catching other people's mistakes
 * [Vim](vim) - optional lesson on using Vim, a customizable text editor that has tons of shortcuts but is hard to use
